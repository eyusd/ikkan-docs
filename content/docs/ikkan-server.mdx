import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

This package handles the server-side part of **Ikkan**. It is designed to be used with Next.js, and it will take care of the boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing the logic of your API.

This package only exposes two functions, that you will use on a well-defined `config` object of type [IkkanConfig](/docs/ikkan-core#type-ikkanconfig).

## Functions

### ikkanHandler

This function will take a [IkkanConfig](/docs/ikkan-core#type-ikkanconfig) object and return an object than can be used by Next.js to handle the request.

```ts
import { ikkanHandler } from "@ikkan/server";
import { config } from "./config";

// If you have a GET endpoint
export const { GET } = await ikkanHandler(config);
```

This code must be placed in a `route.ts` file, that will be used by Next.js to define the route of your endpoint.

Some considerations:
- **Error handling**: The error handling is done automatically by **Ikkan**. If an error is thrown in your function, it will be wrapped in a `SerializedError` object, and sent to the client.
- **Schema validation**: The schema validation is done automatically by **Ikkan**. If the data sent by the client does not match the schema, a 400 error will be sent to the client.
- **Params**: 
  - In the case of a method using search params (such as `GET`), the params will be passed in a single search params, named `params`. You can access them using `req.query.params`.
  - In the case of a method using a body (such as `POST`), the body will be passed in the body, as JSON. You can access them using `req.body`.

### ikkanServerBridge

This function will take a [IkkanConfig](/docs/ikkan-core#type-ikkanconfig) object and return a function that will call the endpoint, intended to be used on the server-side.

```ts
import { ikkanServerBridge } from "@ikkan/server";
import { config } from "./config";

export const serverBridge = ikkanServerBridge(config);
```

This function first will take the params of the endpoint and return a fetcher function that will call the endpoint with params and return the result.

```ts
const fetcher = serverBridge({ id: "123" });
const result = await fetcher({ name: "world" }); // You can pass RequestInit to the fetcher
```
