import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';

This package handles the client-side part of **Ikkan**. It is designed to be used with Next.js, and it will take care of the boilerplate code for you, so you can focus on writing the logic of your API.

It is designed to word with [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/), a library that will handle the caching and revalidation of your data. As such, you can define data mutations that will update the cache when you define your client-side functions. You will be free from the hassle of updating the cache yourself.

## Functions

### ikkanClientBridge

This function will take a [IkkanConfig](/docs/ikkan-core#type-ikkanconfig) object and return a function that will call the endpoint, intended to be used on the client-side.

```ts
import { ikkanClientBridge } from "@ikkan/client";
import { config } from "./config";

export const { hook, action } = ikkanClientBridge(config);
```

The `hook` function is a version of the `useSWR` hook that will call the endpoint and cache the result. It will return the data and the error. As the data cannot be `undefined`, you will have to handle the case where the data is not yet fetched.

To use the hook, first call the function with the params of the endpoint, and then call the returned function with `RequestInit` options or `params` if the endpoint supports it.

```ts
const { data, error } = hook({ id: "123" })({ name: "world" }); // You can pass RequestInit to the fetcher
```

To call the endpoint without caching the result, you can use the `action` function. First pass the params of the endpoint, and then call the returned function with `RequestInit` options or `params` if the endpoint supports it.

```ts
const { get: getGreeting } = action({ id: "123" });
const greeting = await getGreeting({ name: "world" }); // You can pass RequestInit to the fetcher
```

### sideEffect

You may wonder how is the cache mutated. This is done by passing an array of functions to `ikkanClientBridge`.\
To help you with that, and to get useful type inference, you can use the `sideEffect` function.

```ts
import { ikkanClientBridge, sideEffect } from "@ikkan/client";
import { config as fromConfig } from "./config";
import { config as toConfig } from "some-other-endpoint/config";

export const { hook, action } = ikkanClientBridge(
  fromConfig,
  [
    sideEffect(
      fromConfig,
      toConfig,
    )({
      endpointGenerator: ({ segments, params, output }) => otherEndpoint(...), // To generate the args required by the other endpoint
      mutator: (cachedValue, response) => someValue(...), // To mutate the cache
    }),
  ],
);
```

This function will need two `IkkanConfig` objects, the first one being the one that will be used to call the endpoint, and the second one being the one that will be used to update the cache.\
It will return a function that will take one or two arguments:
- if the endpoint associated with the data mutation is dynamic, `endpointGenerator` must be defined. It is a function that will take:
  - `segments`: the segments of the endpoint currently being fetched (from `fromConfig`)
  - `params`: the params of the endpoint currently being fetched (from `fromConfig`)
  - `output`: the output of the endpoint currently being fetched (from `fromConfig`)
  It must return the args that will be passed to the other endpoint (from `toConfig`).
- `mutator` must be defined. It is a function that will take:
  - `cachedValue`: the value currently in the cache (from `toConfig`), that can be `undefined`.
  - `response`: the response of the endpoint currently being fetched (from `fromConfig`)
  It must return the new value that will be in the cache, possibly `undefined`.
