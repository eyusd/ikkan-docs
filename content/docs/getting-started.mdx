import { File, Folder, Files } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/files';

There is no obligations about how you should structure your files, but here is a recommended structure:

<Files>
  <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="api" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="greeting" defaultOpen>
        <File name="config.ts" />
        <File name="route.ts" />
        <File name="bridge.ts" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

### `config.ts`

This file is used to define how your endpoint will behave. It should export [IkkanConfig](/docs/ikkan-core#type-ikkanconfig) objects, that will be used to configure actual implementations of your endpoint and client-side/server-side functions.\

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={
`import { ikkanConfig } from "@ikkan/core";
import { z } from "zod";

export const config = ikkanConfig({
\tendpoint: () => "/api/greeting",
\tmethod: "GET",
\tschema: z.string(),
\tfn: async (_req, name) => {
\t\treturn 'Hello, ' + name + '!';
\t},
});`
} />

### `route.ts`

It is the file that Next.js uses to define the route of your endpoint.\
It should export a function that will be used when calling to that specific endpoint. You don't have to write much in this file, as **Ikkan** will take care of the boilerplate for you.\
You can export multiple functions, if you endpoint supports multiple methods.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={
`import { ikkanHandler } from "@ikkan/server";
import { config } from "./config";

export const { GET } = await ikkanHandler(config);
`
} />

### `bridge.ts`

This file is used to define the client-side or server-side function that will call your endpoint.\
It is you responsibility as a developer to export relevant functions (server-side, client-side without SWR, client-side with SWR) that will call the endpoint.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={
  `import { ikkanClientBridge } from "@ikkan/server";
import { config } from "./config";

export const { hook: useGetGreeting, action: getGreeting } = ikkanClientBridge(config);
`
} />
